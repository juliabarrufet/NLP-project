# NLP-project

This project consists on building an algorithm that is able to identify the key positive and negative aspects of a hotel according to the reviews given by its customers. The code of the project contains three different approaches to study the mentioned goal. 

This directory contains three different elements:
* **Hotel_Reviews.csv**: A CSV file with the dataset.
* **NLP_project.Rmd**: An R Notebook of the project that will reproduce step by step, the procedure followed to develop the three analysis of reviews, from uploading the dataset to the generation of the graphical results.
* **NLP_project.html**: An HTML file containing the rendered version of the R Notebook, together with brief explanations of the procedure and the conclusions of each analysis.
* **NLP_project_report.pdf**: A four pages report of the developed project.

To reproduce the code of the project:
1. First, place the R Notebook "NLP_project.Rmd" in the same folder as the "Hotel_Reviews.csv" file.
2. Open the R notebook on _RStudio_ and set the project folder as your working directory with `setwd("your project directory")`.
3. Install the packages that you do not have already installed from the list of libraries at the beginning of the code.
4. Run the code chunks to see the output of the project (run them in order for an optimal reproducibility).
